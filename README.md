# 🧩 Mini Projects in Python and C

This repository contains **two folders of beginner-friendly mini programs** written in **Python** and **C**. These small projects were created for learning, practice, and fun!

They are designed to demonstrate core programming concepts such as input/output, control structures, file handling, and basic algorithms.

## 💡 What's Inside?

### ✅ Python Projects
- Simple CLI-based programs
- Focus on ease of understanding and file-based data handling
- Written in a clean and beginner-friendly style

### 🧠 C Projects
- Console-based applications
- Emphasize logic, pointers, and user interaction
- Great for understanding memory and performance

./program

🎯 Purpose of This Repo

This repository is part of my personal learning journey in programming and computer science. It aims to:

Reinforce basic programming skills in multiple languages
Serve as a reference for small, practical coding problems
Help other students or beginners by sharing real code examples

📌 Notes
All projects are written from scratch.
Python and C were chosen to cover both high-level scripting and low-level systems programming.
Feel free to explore, learn, and even contribute!
