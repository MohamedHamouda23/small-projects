# 📚 About This Project

This project was originally developed as part of a university assignment at the **University of the West of England (UWE)** 🏫 and is now shared as part of my **personal portfolio and resume**. 

🛠️ It's here to showcase my work and to help others learn — you're welcome to explore the structure, coding style, and problem-solving approach for educational purposes.

🚫 **Please don’t copy or submit it as your own** — that would go against academic integrity policies and could be considered plagiarism.

👍 **Feel free to use it for inspiration**, learn from it, and use what you learn to build something even better!

# 📁 Python Projects

## 📋 Overview

This repository hosts **three small Python projects** designed to demonstrate programming skills such as user input handling, validation, file management, and logic implementation. Each project is self-contained within this repository and demonstrates different fundamental programming concepts:

- 🧮 **Simple Interest Calculator** *(University Assignment)*  
- 🏆 **High Score Tracker** *(University Assignment)*  
- 📝 **To-Do List (Task Manager)** *(Personal Project)*

---

## 🚀 Projects Description

### 1. 🧮 Simple Interest Calculator  
A simple command-line program that calculates the simple interest based on user inputs for principal, rate, and time.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Arithmetic operations, user input handling.

---

### 2. 🏆 High Score Tracker  
A program that tracks and updates a high score entered by users. It demonstrates use of loops, conditionals, and variable management.  
**Skills demonstrated:** Conditionals, loops, variable storage.

---

### 3. 📝 To-Do List (Task Manager)  
A console-based task manager that lets users add, remove, and mark tasks as completed or uncompleted. Tasks are stored persistently in a CSV file.  
**Features:**  
- Add tasks with priority, category, due date, and completion status  
- Remove tasks by name and category  
- Toggle completion status of tasks  
- CSV file handling for data persistence  
**Skills demonstrated:** File handling, data validation, object-oriented programming, user input validation.
