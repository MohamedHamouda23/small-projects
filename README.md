# 📚 About This Project

This project was originally developed as part of a university assignment at the University of the West of England (UWE) 🏫 and is now shared as part of my personal portfolio and resume.

🛠️ It's here to showcase my work and to help others learn — you're welcome to explore the structure, coding style, and problem-solving approach for educational purposes.

🚫 Please don’t copy or submit it as your own — that would go against academic integrity policies and could be considered plagiarism.

👍 Feel free to use it for inspiration, learn from it, and use what you learn to build something even better!

# 📁 Projects Overview

This repository hosts **three small python projects** designed to demonstrate basic programming skills such as user input handling, arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and file management. Each project is self-contained with its own directory and README file explaining its purpose, features, and usage instructions:

- 🧮 Simple Interest Calculator 
- 🏆 High Score Tracker 
- 📝 To-Do List (Task Manager) 

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. 🧮 Simple Interest Calculator 
A simple calculator that computes interest based on user input values. This project covers basic arithmetic operations and user input processing.

More details: [Simple Interest Calculator README](Python/Interest_Calculator/README.md)



### 2. 🏆 High Score Tracker 
A program that tracks and updates a high score from user inputs, illustrating the use of loops, conditionals, and variable management.

More details: [High Score README](Python/Score_Manager/README.md)



### 3. 📝 To-Do List (Task Manager) **(personal project)**  
A console-based task manager that allows adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed, demonstrating file handling, data validation, and user input processing.

More details: [To do list README](Python/To_do_list/README.md)
