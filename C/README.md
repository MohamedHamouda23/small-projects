# 📚 About This Project

This project was developed as a **personal learning exercise** while studying at the **University of the West of England (UWE)** 🏫 and is now shared as part of my personal portfolio and resume.

🛠️ It’s designed to demonstrate my skills in C programming — including file handling, struct usage, user input validation, and basic logic. You’re welcome to explore the structure, code style, and approach for educational purposes.

🚫 Please don’t copy or submit it as your own — that would go against academic integrity policies and could be considered plagiarism.

👍 Feel free to use it for inspiration, learn from it, and use what you learn to build something even better!


# 📁 Project Overview

This repository hosts a single **C language project** that simulates a **student grade management system**. It is a console-based application that uses CSV file storage and demonstrates the following concepts:

- ✅ User input handling  
- 🧠 Data validation and struct usage  
- 📁 File reading and writing  
- 🔁 Menu-driven program logic


# 🚀 Project

## 🎓 Student Grade Manager (Personal Project)

A console-based program written in C that allows you to:

- Add a new student record (name 4 module grades)
- Check the **highest and lowest** grade for a student
- Determine if a student has **passed or failed**

Each record is stored in a file (`student.csv`), and the program applies input validation and a basic grading system from A to F.
