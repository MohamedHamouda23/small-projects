# 📚 About This Project

This project was developed as a **personal learning exercise** during my self-study journey, with the goal of deepening my understanding of programming concepts through hands-on practice and real-world application.

🛠️ It’s designed to demonstrate my skills in C programming — including file handling, struct usage, user input validation, and basic logic. You’re welcome to explore the structure, code style, and approach for educational purposes.

🚫 Please don’t copy or submit it as your own — that would go against academic integrity policies and could be considered plagiarism.

👍 Feel free to use it for inspiration, learn from it, and use what you learn to build something even better!


# 📁 Projects Overview
